## What is SpaceXpanse Multiverse?
In these hectic times, we often ask ourselves, what is a good opportunity? Who can we trust? Which project has real potential? Here are a couple of answers why SpaceXpanse Multiverse is the right choice:  

✅ SpaceXpanse Multiverse is a top-notch project that merges blockchain and AI to create a trustless GameFi platform. This platform, designed for immersive user experience and decentralized applications, provides a space where users can interact and engage without limits.  
✅ Key to the Multiverse platform are its core technologies, including the ROD blockchain, which powers transactions and storage for its native utility coin - ROD, tokens, NFTs, and a key-value database. The platform also features decentralized DNS for secure domain resolution and digital IDs for trustless user authentication.  
✅ Empowering users with innovative features, the platform offers atomic trading for asset exchange and a Play-and-Earn model, allowing users to earn rewards while using applications. Development tools like SpeX Library and Democrit facilitate seamless integration with third-party applications, while the DappEngine simplifies the creation of decentralized apps.  
✅ The Metaverse Simulator is the ultimate tool for testing virtual environments, while Metalog will be its inner decentralized social network. The AI-powered chatbot - D.A.R.M.A., will welcome and assist the users in every possible way. There will be Startup Hub that will support projects and initiatives by third parties.  
✅ Our team of devoted professionals with expertise in different fields follows a structured roadmap, with stages focused on laying the foundation, scaling up, and community engagement.  
✅ The platform operates under the MIT license, promoting collaboration and innovation by granting developers freedom to modify and distribute their software. Also, it ensures transparency through a registered NGO, allowing community members to track expenses and contribute to development through donations.  
✅ With its visionary approach and commitment to progress, SpaceXpanse, without a shadow of a doubt, will revolutionize the crypto space and unlock new possibilities in the decentralized metaverse GameFi ecosystem.    
✅ This is a long-term project that is based on real development and not on mere speculation. The people behind it have the vision, the energy, the knowledge, and the agenda to become major players in the field, so trusting SpaceXpanse Multiverse in this early stage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.   

## What does ROD blockchain do?

✔ Create, store and transact its main cryptocurrency - ROD coin, fungible and nonfungible tokens /NFTs/.  
✔ Support two PoW algorithms: neoscrypt-xaya and SHA-256d - for merged mining, generating blocks every 30 seconds in 3 to 1 ratio.  
✔ Grant halving the block reward every year for 5 years, then ~3% annual inflation of the block reward for 59 years.  
✔ Allow register and transfer of arbitrary names /digital IDs/ for trustless user identification, which can hold and transfer value.  
✔ Provide a fair amount of secure data storage in every block, delivering possibility for near real-time communication between the nodes.  
✔ Support Atomic trading for exchange of in-game assets (fungible currencies as well as non-fungible items) in a trustless manner.  
✔ Possess Play-to-Earn functionality, which allows a part of the block rewards to be "placed" inside a decentralized application /DApp/, where users can pick/win them up and bank them to their on-chain address. /WIP/  

And the blockchain and its [core wallet](http://https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet "ROD core wallet") serve as the foundational layer in the platform, providing essential functions such as secure value and data storage, transaction processing, mining, and network connectivity for users to interact with the blockchain network. Additionally, the ROD core wallet serves as a tool for users to manage their ROD holdings and participate in various activities within the platform, further enhancing its utility.
