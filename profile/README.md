# Our mission
The **main goal** that we pursue is simple yet proved difficult: t*o introduce technology behind the blockchain into the real world, to help it become more suitable for every day use and not to be just an investment opportunity for a few*. We think this can be achieved by easing the learning curve through **gamification**. We also want to turn the game around /pun intended/ and for the people to start making money while playing and not vice versa, using the so-called **Play And Earn** model.

The outcome of this desire will be **unstoppable, unreversible, serverless blockchain backed ecosystem**, in which any kind of applications can be developed using your favorite programming language in the process – *your imagination is the only limit*. 

To showcase the idea we decided to make a game or two: the **first** one will be *open source sandbox single player game* with near real physical forces and the **second** is based on the first one but *multiplayer with trustless ownership, player-driven open economy* and closed source code for the game engine and logic. And because we truly believe in the opportunities that **Space ex**ploration will give us, both are based in our *Solar system* for starters. 

We will continue to broaden the boundaries of this platform even further, making it as vast and independent as humanly/softwarely possible. Like Space itself.
