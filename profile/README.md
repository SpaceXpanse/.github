# Our mission
The main goal that we persue is simple yet proved difficult: *to introduce technology behind the blockchain into the real world, to help it become more suitable for every day usage and not to be just an investment opportunity for a few*. We think that this can be anchieved by easing the learning curve through gemification. We also want to turn the game around /pun intended/ and for the peolple to start making money while playing and not vice versa, using the so-called **Play And Earn** model.

The outcome of this desire will be **unstoppable, unreversable, serverless blockchain** backed ecosystem, in which any kind of applications can be developed using your favourite programing language in the process - your imagination is the only limit.
To showcase the idea **we decided to make a game** or two: the **first** one will be *open source sandbox single player game* with near real phisical forces and the **second** is based on the first one but *multiplayer with true ownership near real economy capabilities* and closed source code for the game engine and logic. And because we trully believe in the opportunities that **Space ex**ploration will give us, both are based in our Solar system for starters.
We will continiue to broaden the boundaries of this platform even further, making it as vast and undependaple as humanly/softwarely possible. Like Space itself.
